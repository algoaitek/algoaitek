## üëã Bio / Fun Fact

**Bio:**  
I'm a software developer with a passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. I founded AlgoAITek after seeing firsthand how teams struggle with hidden dependencies in large-scale projects. My goal is to build tools that eliminate ambiguity and empower teams to collaborate more effectively.

**Fun Fact:**  
My 'fun fact' is that I genuinely enjoy untangling digital knots‚Äîwhether it's a complex dependency graph in Jira, a tricky recursive algorithm in my code, or optimizing an API call to be just a few milliseconds faster.

## üé® Design Style Preferences

- **Style:** Minimal, professional, and data-driven.
- **Aesthetic:** Reflecting "AlgoAITek"‚Äîclean lines, clear hierarchy, and a focus on functionality. Whitespace is used effectively to avoid clutter.
- **Color Palette:** Tech-focused palette‚Äîdark grays or deep blues for base, white for text, and a single vibrant accent color (bright cyan, electric blue, or orange) for buttons, links, and key highlights. This creates a modern, trustworthy look.
